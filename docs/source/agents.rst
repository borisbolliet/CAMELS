CAMELS Agents

As the CAMELS project matures:

- The number of simulations increases
- The number of scientific papers using CAMELS grows
- The documentation becomes longer
- The details about different codes and simulations become harder to track

To help researchers use CAMELS data, we have created a set of AI agents tailored specifically to CAMELS. These agents can assist with tasks such as:

- Writing CAMELS data sections
- Answering technical questions about CAMELS
- Finding relevant CAMELS papers
- Discovering papers across the entire arXiv
- Writing code to analyze CAMELS data
- Using general-purpose LLMs with CAMELS-specific context
